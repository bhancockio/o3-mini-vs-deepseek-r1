# Results from Round 03

**Winner:** 03 Mini

**Core Observations:**
- DeepSeek once again struggled with managing a large amount of context. Its refactored code dropped some of the core functionality, as it lost sight of the original goal: to clean up and improve the code without breaking it.
- While DeepSeek went farther in "making things more Pythonic" and offered some interesting suggestions, many of these changes were half baked and ultimately caused functionality regressions.
- 03 Mini, on the other hand, required minimal guidance. It cleanly refactored and improved the code while preserving its core behavior. However, it did not incorporate the internationalization changes as expected—it attempted to introduce its own i18n solution instead of leveraging the existing one.
- With one quick follow-up to address the i18n integration, 03 Mini’s output would be a fully working solution.

**How I'm Going to Use These Models Going Forward:**
- I will use 03 Mini for refactoring and code cleanup tasks because it reliably maintains the integrity of the existing code. Its ability to produce a minimally invasive, working solution is key.
- Although DeepSeek provided a bold, more radical refactoring, its tendency to over-apply changes and drop critical functionality means I will avoid it for refactoring tasks and instead reserve it for generating creative ideas.
- I appreciate some of DeepSeek’s suggestions to enforce better Python practices, and I plan to revisit these ideas later—but for now, I’ll continue refining with 03 Mini.`
